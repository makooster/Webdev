    <h1>Gangsta's paradise</h1>
    <p>As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death <br>
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left <br>
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that <br>
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it <br>
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of <br>
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin' <br>
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk <br>
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc <br>
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke <br>
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like <br>
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight <br>
Been spendin' most their lives<br>
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise<br>
Been spendin' most their lives<br>
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise<br>
Keep spendin' most our lives<br>
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise<br>
Keep spendin' most our lives<br>
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise<br>
